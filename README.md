# RL4UAV
Autonomous Navigation of UAV using Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning). For discrete action space: 5x5 grid space
Indoor Path Planning and Navigation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on PID+Q-Learning algorithm (Reinforcement Learning). The quadrotor maneuvers towards the goal point, along the uniform grid distribution in the simulation environment(discrete action space) based on the specified reward policy, backed by the simple position based PID controller.
